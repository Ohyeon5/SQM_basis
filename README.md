# SQM basis 

Human visual perception is rather discrete than continuous. Drissi-Daoudi and colleagues used SQM (sequential meta-contrast) paradigm and figured out that there is discrete time windows (~450ms) for visual temporal integration. Here with computational models, we examine what makes us perceive discrete way and what is the source of opening and closing the perceptual time windows.

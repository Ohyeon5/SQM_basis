# SQM basis 

Human visual perception is rather discrete than continuous. Drissi-Daoudi and colleagues used SQM (sequential meta-contrast) paradigm and figured out that there is discrete time windows (~450ms) for visual temporal integration. Here with computational models, we examine what makes us perceive discrete way and what is the source of opening and closing the perceptual time windows. 

We combined two distinct projects, SQM_frame prediction and SQM_discreteness proejcts, together in the current project.

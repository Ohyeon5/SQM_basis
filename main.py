"""Model training and testing script

This script allows you to train and test the models on a couple of tasks.

There are two supported tasks:
1) Hand gesture classification: based on a sequence of images representing a hand gesture,
the model labels the sequence with a hand gesture
2) L/R vernier discrimination: based on a sequence of images containing a vernier,
the model labels the sequence as a left or right vernier
